# Linear-Regression-Model-Selection

## Summary:
Using R, I minimized Mallows' Cp values and predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) to improve the linear regression model's predictive ability for fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) in USA, Japan, and Germany. Both Least angle regression (Lars) and the branch-and-bound algorithm (leaps) aims at finding the best subset of predictors.

## Dataset used:
This dataset is included in the ISLR package in R. 

## Business Problem:
Linear regression is utilized extensively in a wide array of fields such as stock trends, customer behavior analysis, process optimization, engineering products, etc. It is useful for finding relationships between variables and predicting behaviors.
