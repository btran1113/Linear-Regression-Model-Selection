# Linear-Regression-Model-Selection

## Summary:
Using R, I minimized Mallows' Cp values and predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) to improve the linear regression model's predictive ability for fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) in USA, Japan, and Germany using Least-angle regression (Lars). 

## Business Problem:
Linear regression is utilized extensively in a wide array of fields such as stock trends, customer behavior analysis, process optimization, engineering products, etc. It is useful for finding relationships between variables and predicting behaviors.
